# Deep Neural Network Training with Frank–Wolfe Algorithm
This project aims to replicate some of the experiments from the paper (Deep Neural Network Training with Frank–Wolfe)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07243].

Expanding on the paper, we will directly compare the algorithm to the popular Adam optimizer and apply it to a different dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- PyTorch 1.11.0
- tqdm 4.64.0
